In nature, nothing is perfect and everything is perfect. Trees can be contorted, bent in weird ways, and they're still beautiful. –Alice Walker 2. Forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair. —Khalil Gibran 3. Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.
